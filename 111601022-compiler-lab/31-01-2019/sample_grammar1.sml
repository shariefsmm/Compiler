(* This file contains a sample grammar which can be copied to grammar.sml and run.
   The grammar is -
                                S -> E$
                                E -> E + T | T
                                T -> T * F | F
                                F -> id | num | ( E )                           *)



(* Set of atoms to represent the symbols in the grammar. *)
val sym = ref AtomSet.empty;

(* Set of atoms to represent the tokens in the grammar. *)
val tok = ref AtomSet.empty;
tok := AtomSet.addList (!tok, [Atom.atom "num", Atom.atom "id", Atom.atom "(", Atom.atom ")", Atom.atom "*", Atom.atom "+", Atom.atom "$"]);


(* Rules corresponding to each symbol in the grammar - each of type Productions.
   First an empty set corresponding to each symbol in the grammar is created and then each production corresponding to the symbol is 
   added successively. *)

val E_ = ref RHSSet.empty;

F_ := RHSSet.add (!F_, [Atom.atom "num"]);	
F_ := RHSSet.add (!F_, [Atom.atom "(", Atom.atom "E", Atom.atom ")"]);


(* Rules corresponding to all the symbols - of type Rules.
   First an empty map is created and then the rules for all the symbols are added successively. *)
val rule : Rules ref = ref AtomMap.empty;

rule := AtomMap.insert (!rule, Atom.atom "E", !E_);

(* Finally all the three components of the grammar - symbols, tokens and rules - defined above are combined in the record grammar
   (of type grammar). *)
